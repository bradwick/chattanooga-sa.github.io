          Group Conscience Meetings
        </h1>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Establish a Chair:</strong> Begin by designating a
          presiding officer or chairperson for the meeting. The chair is
          responsible for maintaining order and following the rules throughout
          the meeting.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Call the Meeting to Order:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The chair calls the meeting to order by saying something like, "I
            call this meeting to order."
          </li>
          <li>
            The chair should then make sure there's a quorum, meaning the
            minimum number of members required to conduct business is present.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Approve the Agenda:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The agenda is typically distributed before the meeting. The chair
            asks if there are any additions or modifications to the agenda.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the agenda is accepted, it becomes the roadmap for the meeting.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Follow the Agenda:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Items are addressed in the order they appear on the agenda.</li>
          <li>
            The chair introduces each item and allows discussion, debate, and
            decision-making on each one.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>5. Making a Motion:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Members may make motions to propose actions or decisions. Motions
            should be clear and specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make a motion, a member typically says, "I move that we [state
            the action or decision]." Another member must second the motion for
            it to be considered.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6. Debate:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After a motion is made and seconded, there is a period for debate.
            Members may discuss the motion's pros and cons.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chair controls debate by recognizing members to speak,
            alternating between those in favor and against the motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members must address their comments to the chair, not directly to
            other members.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>7. Voting:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When debate concludes, the chair calls for a vote. Voting can be
            done by voice, show of hands, or ballot, depending on the
            organization's rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            A majority vote is usually required to pass a motion. Some motions
            may require a two-thirds majority.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>8. Handling Amendments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Members may propose amendments to motions. These amendments are
            treated as separate motions and follow the same process of
            discussion and voting.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>9. Point of Order:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any member can raise a "point of order" if they believe a rule is
            being violated. The chair must address this point before continuing.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>10. Calling for a Recess or Adjournment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A member may move to take a short recess or to adjourn the meeting.
            This requires a second and a vote.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>11. Recording Minutes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A secretary or designated member records the minutes of the meeting.
            These minutes include the main motions, their results, and any
            important discussions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>12. Announcements and Future Business:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The chair may allow time for announcements, upcoming events, and
            discussions about future business.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>13. Closing the Meeting:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The chair adjourns the meeting by saying, "I move that we adjourn"
            or a similar statement. This requires a second and a vote.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>14. Review Minutes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the beginning of the next meeting, the minutes of the previous
            meeting are typically reviewed and approved.
          </li>
        </ul>
