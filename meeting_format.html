        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Good morning/evening, my name is ________ and I’m a gratefully recovering Sexaholic. Welcome to this meeting of Sexaholics Anonymous.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> This is a closed meeting. Only those desiring their own personal sexual sobriety, please. Due to the nature of our addiction, and the need for unity in the group, we ask that members dress with modesty. No tight or revealing clothing, please.</p>

            The SA Purpose
          </h1>
          <p>Sexaholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop lusting and become sexually sober. There are no dues or fees for SA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. SA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sexually sober and help others to achieve sexual sobriety.</p>

            What is a Sexaholic and what is Sexual Sobriety?
          </h1>
          <p>We can only speak for ourselves. The specialized nature of Sexaholics Anonymous can best be understood in terms of what we call the Sexaholic. The Sexaholic has taken himself or herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice, and is not free to stop. Lust has become an addiction. Our situation is like that of the alcoholic who can no longer tolerate alcohol and must stop drinking all together, but is hooked and cannot stop. So it is with the sexaholic, or sex drunk, who can no longer tolerate lust but cannot stop.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Thus, for the Sexaholic, any form of sex with one’s self or with partners other than the spouse is progressively addictive and destructive. We also see that lust is the driving force behind our sexual acting out, and true sobriety includes progressive victory over lust. These conclusions where forced upon us in the crucible of our experiences and recovery; we have no other options. But we have found that acceptance of these facts is a key to a happy and joyous freedom we could otherwise never know.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This will and should discourage many inquirers who admit to sexual obsession or compulsion, but who simply want to control and enjoy it, much as the alcoholic would like to control and enjoy drinking. Until we had been driven to the point of despair, until we really wanted to stop but could not, we did not give ourselves to this program of recovery. Sexaholics Anonymous is for those who know they have no other option but to stop, and their own enlightened self-interest must tell them this.</p>

            The Problem
          </h1>
          <p>Many of us felt inadequate, unworthy, alone, and afraid. Our insides never matched what we saw on the outsides of others. Early on, we can to feel disconnected from parent, from peers, from ourselves. We tuned out with fantasy and masturbation. We plugged in by drinking in the pictures, the images, and pursuing the objects of our fantasies. We lusted and wanted to be lusted after. We became true addicts: sex with self, promiscuity, adultery, dependency relationships, and more fantasy. We got it through the eyes; we bought it, we sold it, we traded it, we gave it away. We were addicted to the intrigue, the tease, the forbidden. The only way we knew to be free of it was to do it. “Please connect with me and make owe whole!”, we cried with outstretched arms.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Lusting after the “Big Fix”, we gave away our power to others. This produced guilt, self-hatred, remorse, emptiness, and pain, and we were driven ever inward, away from reality, away from love, lost inside ourselves. Our habit made true intimacy impossible. We could never know real union with another because we were addicted to the unreal. We went for the “chemistry”, the connection that had the magic, because it bypassed intimacy and true union. Fantasy corrupted the real; lust killed love. First addicts, then love cripples, we took from others to fill up what was lacking in ourselves. Conning ourselves time and again that the next one would save us, we were really losing our lives.</p>

          <h1 class="font-light text-2xl mt-10 mb-6">
            The Solution
          </h1>
          <p>We saw that our problem was threefold: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Healing had to come about in all three. The crucial change in attitude began when we admitted we were powerless, that our habit had us whipped. We came to meetings and withdrew from our habit. For some, this meant no sex with themselves or others, including not getting into relationships. For others it also meant “drying out” and not having sex with the spouse for a time to recover from lust.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We discovered that we could stop, that not feeding the hunger didn’t kill us, that sex was indeed optional. There was hope for freedom, and we began to feel alive. Encouraged to continue, we turned more and more away from our isolating obsession with sex and self and turned to God and others. All this was scary. We couldn’t see the path ahead, except that others had gone that way before.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Each new step of surrender felt it would be off the edge into oblivion, but we took it. And instead of killing us, surrender was killing the obsession! We had stepped into the light, into a while new way of life. The fellowship gave us monitoring and support to keep us from being overwhelmed, a safe haven where we could finally face ourselves. Instead of covering our feelings with compulsive sex, we began exposing the roots of our spiritual emptiness and hunger. And the healing began.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As we faced our defects, we became willing to change; surrendering them broke the power they had over us. We began to be more comfortable with ourselves and others for the first time without our “drug”! Forgiving all who had injured us, and without injuring others, we tried to right our own wrongs. At each amends, more of the dreadful load of guilt dropped from our shoulders, until we could lift our heads, look the world in the eye, and stand free.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We began practicing a positive sobriety, taking the actions of love to improve our relations with others. We were learning how to give, and the measure we gave was the measure we got back. We were finding what none of the substitutes had ever supplied. We were making the real Connection. We were home</p>

          <h1 class="font-light text-2xl mt-10 mb-6">
            How it Works
          </h1>
          <h1 class="font-light text-2xl mt-10 mb-6">
            From Chapter Five of Alcoholics Anonymous
          </h1>
          <p>Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it, then you are ready to take certain steps. At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas, and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.  Remember that we deal with lust-cunning, baffling, and powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power-that one is God. May you find Him now.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon. Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</p>
          <br>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-8">
            <li>We admitted that we were powerless over lust-that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
            <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
            <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
            <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
            <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
            <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
            <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
            <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
            <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
            <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
            <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to sexaholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it." Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection... . Our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:</p>
          <ol class="pl-2">
            <li>(a) That we were sexaholics and could not manage our own lives.</li>
            <li>(b) That probably no human power could have relieved our sexaholism.</li>
            <li>(c) That God could and would if He were sought.</li>

            THE TWELVE TRADITIONS OF SEXAHOLICS ANONYMOUS
          </h1>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-8">
            <li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends on SA unity.</li>
            <li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority-a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
            <li>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop lusting and become sexually sober.</li>
            <li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or Sexaholics Anonymous as a whole.</li>
            <li>Each group has but one primary purpose-to carry its message to the sexaholic who still suffers.</li>
            <li>An SA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the SA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
            <li>Every SA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>
            <li>Sexaholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>
            <li>SA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
            <li>Sexaholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the SA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
            <li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, films, and TV.</li>
            <li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <br>


        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Is there anyone that wants a desire chip, indicating your desire to stay sober? Are there any dates to celebrate (weekly or monthly or any annual birthdays)?</p>
        <br>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Because it is important to create a safe place where we can share about our disease, this is a closed meeting, only for people desiring their own personal sexual sobriety. If there is anyone who is a newcomer, who has not had a newcomer's meeting, or who is not sure whether or not you are a sexaholic, we ask that you honor this closed meeting and attend an informational newcomer's meeting (provided now as a breakout meeting). Is there anyone here for their first SA meeting? </p>
        <br>


        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader asks:</span> “Are there any announcements?”</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> In participation, we avoid topics that can lead to dissension or distraction. We also avoid explicit sexual descriptions and sexually abusive language. The emphasis is on honesty, recovery and healing—how to apply the twelve steps and traditions in our daily lives. No cross-talk, please. If someone feels another is getting too explicit, they may so signify by quietly raising their hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Anonymity does not imply legal confidentiality. Please refrain from disucssiong illegal acts that nave not been adjudicated by the authorities.</p>
        <br>


        <p><span class="font-semibold">Conclusion:</span> (around the 55th minute of the meeting)</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> It’s time for our 7th tradition. (Pass the basket) “We have no dues of fees but we are self supporting through our own contributions.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> This group recognizes the importance of sponsorship. Experience shows that participation on either end of this spiritual relationship—whether as sponsor or sponsee—helps us maintain our sobriety and promotes growth and recovery. The White Book says, “There are few requirements a prospective sponsor should have, but a period of comfortable sexual sobriety, including progressive victory over lust, is surely a must. Another requirement is that he or she be ahead of us in working the Steps.” (p. 73-74). Will all who qualify and are willing to be a sponsor raise your hand? Those who do not have a sponsor and would like one, please see one of these people after the meeting.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Anything you have heard at this meeting is strictly the opinion of the individual participant; the principles of SA are found in our Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. This is an anonymous program; Please keep the name, address, and phone number of anyone you meet or learn about in SA to yourself. And what we say here, let it stay here. Remember that we never identify ourselves publicly with SA in the press, radio, TV, or films. Neither does anyone speak for SA.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Leader:</span> Let us renew our sobriety together today. I will read four questions; we will answer together: “Yes” or “No”</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal px-12">
          <li>Can you, with me, admit that you are utterly powerless over the impulses and fantasies of lust?</li>
          <li>And at the same time, with me, can you claim and own at this moment desire in your heart to spend the next 24 hours free from entertaining lust or acting it out?</li>
          <li>Are you willing to do whatever you need to do to protect that desire for sobriety by turning to your Higher Power when tempted, deepening it by reading literature, strengthening it by reaching out to others when necessary as you are now?</li>
          <li>Finally, are you willing to hand over, just for these 24 hours, your will and life to the care of the Higher Power who has protected you from the full consequences of your lust?</li>
        </ol>

          </h1>
        <p>We realize we know only a little. God will constantly disclose more to you and to us. Ask Him in your morning meditation what you can do each day for the man who is still sick. The answers will come, if your own house is in order. But obviously you cannot transmit something you haven't got. See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us. Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny. May God bless you and keep you-until then.</p>
