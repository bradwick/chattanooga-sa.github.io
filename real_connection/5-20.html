          A Power Greater Than Myself
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity (SA 5).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>Before I came to SA, I knew my life was unmanageable. I was afraid to admit this to others because I feared there was no remedy. However, at my first meeting I saw the solution at work. Self-described sexaholics were living happy and productive lives free from sexual acting out. The problem got me in the door and seeing the solution in action kept me coming back. At first, the “Power greater than myself ” was the group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I saw the power of lust in my life, it was easier for me to connect with the second part of Step Two, that I needed restoration to sanity. My unmanageability under the influence of lust was obvious. Acting out was my standard response to every form of stress. Pursuit of pornography became obsessive. No longer could I blame alcohol or substances for my insane thinking and behavior. I caused pain to myself and others while under the influence of a self-generated drug. If that is not insanity, I do not know what is. Even though I had success in recovering from another addiction, in SA I was advised to start at the beginning, as though I had never heard of the Steps. I was slowly coming to believe.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>God, thank you for leading me into the company of men and women who have a desire to stop lusting.</i></p>
