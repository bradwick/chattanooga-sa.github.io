          Six-Word Limit
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">We had to get down to causes and conditions (AA 64).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>I can bury the truth under an excess of words. One way to help me let the truth come out is, when writing a Fourth Step or a Step Ten inventory, I allow myself only six words to identify my discomfort. When I use much more than six words, I may be trying to hide something.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, in my Tenth Step inventory, the first resentment I listed was against my wife. “She didn’t ask for or remember the time we were supposed to arrive at a party and how people would look at me because we were late”–27 words.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This sentence seemed dishonest and misleading. The self-righteous tone was as much a clue as the number of words. I shortened the resentment to, “How others would perceive our coming late and I couldn’t blame the tardiness on my wife”–16 words–then to, “How people would look at me for choosing an irresponsible mate”–11 words.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I kept erasing and rewriting until I found the root: “I fear others’ opinions of me”–six words. It was fear, not resentment, that had been causing my discomfort, and I had buried the fear under the words. Unconscious fears keep me restless, irritable, and discontent—just how my addicted-side wants me to be.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The forced economy of words uncovered the fear. Now I can take the action suggested in the Big Book–humbly rely on my HP to help me match calamity with serenity (AA 68), in other words, help me handle any outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Higher Power, help me to find what is really upsetting me, for only then can I find solutions.</i></p>
