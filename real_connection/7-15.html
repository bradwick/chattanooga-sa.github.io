        <p><span class="font-semibold">As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action (AA 87).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>My agitation begins as we take the “wrong” car to work this morning. I think we should have taken the other one. In my mind I start compiling a list of every reason why my wife’s decision to take this car was wrong. My mouth stays shut, but as I pay more attention to her wrongs, I pay less attention to driving safely. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Fortunately, my years in SA recovery kick in, and I quietly turn to my Higher Power. I hear the question: Is being upset about taking this car to work worth losing your serenity, which could lead you to act out? Of course not! I ask my Higher Power what is the next right action. The answers I get are: Surrender your resentment. Focus on the present moment and concentrate on driving safely. Oh, and also be grateful you have more than one car. </p>
        <br>
        <p>No longer is my mind filled with negative thoughts. With each mile of purposeful driving my mind clears and my serenity blossoms. I am back on track. When I drop off my wife, I am smiling and laughing—all due to working the Steps on my problem. </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Higher Power, thank you for granting me the courage to live the SA principles each day.</i></p>
