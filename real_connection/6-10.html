          Came To Believe
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity (SA 6).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>My addictive activities were always misguided attempts to shore up my self-image. I sought sexual satisfaction so that I could feel better about myself. I used deception and lies to prevent others from knowing how I really felt about myself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Twelve Step program pulled off my mask of deception and let me view my real self. For the first time in my life, I got rigorously honest. I recognized the harm I had done to others and myself. I admitted that alone I do not have the power to stop acting out or to manage my life. At the same time, Step Two promised that if I were willing to believe, then a Power greater than myself could lead me to sanity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This was the basis for my recovery in SA. I began to believe. I sobered up. I became honest in my relationships. I found this Higher Power not only forgave me for my weaknesses but also helped me change my dishonest life into one of integrity. I began to feel alive.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Gracious Higher Power, continue to bless my recovery from the sickness my lies covered up. Let me be honest in all my words and deeds.</i></p>
