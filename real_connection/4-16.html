          The Root Of The Problem
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs (AA 59).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>After working several inventories and sharing them, I realized the obvious eight hundred pound gorilla in the working of the Fifth Step. Nature (singular), wrongs (plural); there was one basic problem, one source of all my character defects and harmful actions: self-centered fear. All my disturbances traced to this root. The only one my decision-making process took into consideration was myself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I denied that we are all in this together, that life is a collective effort, with no person being of greater importance than someone else. When one ignores a truth so vast, it can only result in a fierce internal struggle. It was impossible to reconcile with myself the delusion that I should take preference above all others. The only thing this produced was terror, which gave birth to my other defects—my failed attempts to deal with my fears.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The solution was to uncover this fundamental truth and to apply it to my decision making. During my healing, many of my shortcomings were easily dealt with. I realized that self-centered fear was “the exact nature” of all my wrong views and actions. Recovery was simplified: search out, expose, and let go of anything that keeps me sick, and then help others do the same.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>God, I have been consumed by self-centeredness. I now expose this wound, abandon fear, embrace love, and accept my proper place in humanity.</i></p>
