          Finding God
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold"> […] finding God […] is not the result of a search at all, but of a moral housecleaning (SA 102).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p> How does my Higher Power come into my life? Imagine a glass filled to the top with water. There is no air in the glass because the water takes up all the space. If I want to get air into the glass, I have to pour out some of the water. Air naturally fills the void left by the water. </p>
        <br>
        <p> So it is with my relationship with God. God is the air, and my self-will is the water. As I become willing to empty myself of destructive sexual habits and surrender self-centered attitudes, God fills me with the courage to act. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Today I know why I could not stop acting out for so many years. I was filled with lust. I did not want to change, but my life became so unmanageable that I turned to SA in desperation. In the program, I learned to surrender my lustful will to God in Steps One, Two, and Three. I found his power enabled me to surrender my harmful behavior, and to work the remaining Steps that helped me make a moral housecleaning. Today my life is immeasurably better because I find God filling my glass with serenity, humility, joy, and opportunities to be of service to others. </p>
        <br>
        <p><i> Higher Power, help me to keep my ego in check and therefore leave open space for You. </i></p>
