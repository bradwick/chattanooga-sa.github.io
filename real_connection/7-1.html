          Acceptance—Come What May
        </h1>

        <p><span class="font-semibold"> When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation—some fact of my life—unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be […] (AA 417).</span></p>
        <br>
        <p> As I first began working the Twelve Steps, my SA sponsor introduced me to this concept: If I cannot accept life as it is, with good and bad alike, then I am saying my Higher Power is not running the universe in a manner that suits me. </p>
        <br>
        <p> When I am caught up in how I want things to be, I have moved away from the will of my Higher Power toward self-will, and it was self-will that fueled my sexual addiction. The Program teaches me that whatever happens to me is God’s will at that moment, even when it does not seem that way. </p>
        <br>
        <p> A recent example: When I made a special trip to the college campus to get a new identification badge, I found the ID office had closed earlier than usual. I was upset. Now I would have to make another trip. On my second trip, however, I got my ID–and an unexpected bonus besides. On the way out, I passed a job recruiter and I asked about employment. Today, over two years later, I am still employed from that recruiter’s referral. I realized later that had the ID office been open on my first trip, I would have missed the recruiter. In my limited view of the world, I had gotten angry, yet everything was going according to my Higher Power’s plan for me. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I had to learn that my Higher Power is concerned solely with my well-being. At times that can mean having to swallow bitter medicine, but medicine necessary to heal my diseased thoughts and attitudes. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Awareness and a spirit of gratitude is the key to that acceptance today. </p>
        <br>
        <p><i> Today I will rely on my Higher Power and accept what comes my way as God’s will. </i></p>
